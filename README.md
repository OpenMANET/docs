# OpenMANET

**OpenMANET** is a Raspberry Pi–based MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network) radio built on **Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah)**. Designed around **Raspberry Pi HATs** and OpenWrt, it supports **802.11s** mesh + **batman-adv**, GPS-driven range testing, and a PTT app, aiming for a rugged, field-ready kit. The project currently targets the **Seeed HaLow** HAT; support for other devices will be added over time. A different BCF raises TX power to ~27 dBm versus Seeed defaults.

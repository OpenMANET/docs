  OpenMANET is a Raspberry Pi–based MANET radio built on Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah).
  Designed around Morse Micro HATs/SDIO boards and OpenWrt, it supports 802.11s
  + batman-adv, GPSD-driven range tests, and a PTT app—aiming for a rugged,
  field-ready kit. A custom BCF enables ~27 dBm TX power vs Seeed defaults.

# OpenMANET Project

**OpenMANET** is a Raspberry Pi–based MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network) radio built on **Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah)**.  
It’s designed around Raspberry Pi HATs and currently built specifically for the Seeed HaLow board, with plans to add support for other devices later.

---

## Description
This project aims to provide a flexible HaLow mesh radio using Raspberry Pi hardware and HaLow HATs. A number of optional components are supported; current testing includes the WaveShare 1850 UPS for power and the Panda Wireless PAU06 USB Wi-Fi adapter (additional drivers are included but not yet fully tested).

> Note: On SDIO-based HaLow builds, the onboard Wi‑Fi usually shares the SDIO bus and cannot be used. On SPI-based HaLow builds (for example Seeed boards), onboard Wi‑Fi works for client access (AP mode).

| Pi2W        |     ✅       | ❓    | ❓   | ✅     |  Have not tested well for comms or BLOS    |
| Pi3B        | ✅           | ❓    | ❓   | ✅     |  Have not tested well for comms or BLOS   |
| HaLowLink2  | ✅           |❌     | ✅   | ✅     |  Not supported on 1.7.0 Yet |
| HT-HD01V2   | ✅           |❌     | ❌   |    ❓  |  Not supported on 1.7.0 Yet   |

> Note: The HaLowLink2 and Heltec HT-HD01V2 are extremely storage limited.
> HalowLink2 - Might be able to do WebUI Comms but poorly
> HT-HD01V2 - USB-C is needed for power, cannot plugin the OpenVLM at the same time. Single slow CPU Core, so newer features may never work.

## Networking Model
- The mesh exposes a flat `10.41.0.0/16` LAN to end users, even though BATMAN-V may send frames over multiple HaLow hops in the background.
- A single Mesh Gate runs strictly in router mode and NATs the MANET into whatever uplink you connect it to, your upstream network stays separate.
- Every mesh point keeps its own DHCP scope and unique 2.4/5 GHz SSID, so clients can join over Ethernet or Wi-Fi and still get a lease during disconnected operations.
- HaLow radios should share the same SSID/password/channel settings so the mesh forms reliably.
- mDNS (`hostname.local`) works across the mesh (on supported clients), so you can do `https://manet01.local` or `ssh root@manet01.local`.
- If your end user device gets a `10.41.x.x` IP, it is on the mesh.

This design is deliberately opinionated to reduce the amount of networking knowledge you need to bring a cluster online. See the dedicated [Networking](./networking) page for the full breakdown.

See [Firmware & Releases](./firmware) for download guidance, naming conventions, and `1.6.x` release notes.

If you run into issues, start with [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) (including the recommended “wipe and re-flash” recovery path).


## Advantages vs. the Seeed image
- Different BCF radio file increases TX power (≈21 dBm → **27 dBm**)  
- Newer build than the Seeed image 
- Includes **802.11s** and **batman-adv** support
